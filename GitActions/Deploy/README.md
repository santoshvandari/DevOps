# Auto Deploy on PR Merge to Main

This GitHub Actions workflow automatically deploys your application to production when a Pull Request is merged into the `main` branch.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Add Workflow File

The workflow file should be placed at:
```
.github/workflows/main.yml
```

### 2. Configure GitHub Secrets

Go to your repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí New repository secret

Add the following secrets:

```
DEPLOY_KEY         - SSH private key for server access
SERVER_HOST        - Your server hostname (e.g., server.example.com)
SERVER_USER        - SSH username (e.g., deploy or ubuntu)
```

**Optional secrets (depending on deployment method):**
```
DOCKER_USERNAME    - Docker Hub username
DOCKER_PASSWORD    - Docker Hub password/token
VERCEL_TOKEN       - Vercel deployment token
NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN - Netlify authentication token
NETLIFY_SITE_ID    - Netlify site ID
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID  - AWS access key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY - AWS secret key
```

### 3. Prepare Deployment Script

Create `script.sh` in your repository root with your deployment logic.

Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

### 4. How It Works

1. Developer creates a Pull Request to `main` branch
2. Code review and approval process
3. PR is merged into `main` branch
4. GitHub Actions workflow is triggered
5. Workflow checks out the code
6. Runs the deployment script
7. Application is deployed to production

## Workflow Triggers

The workflow runs when:
- ‚úÖ Pull Request is **merged** into `main` branch
- ‚úÖ Direct push to `main` branch

The workflow does NOT run when:
- ‚ùå Pull Request is created (but not merged)
- ‚ùå Pull Request is closed without merging

## Example Usage

### Create a Pull Request
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin feature/new-feature
```

### Merge Pull Request
1. Go to GitHub and create Pull Request
2. Request review from team members
3. Once approved, click "Merge pull request"
4. Deployment will automatically start

## Deployment Methods

The `script.sh` includes examples for multiple deployment methods:

### 1. SSH Deployment
```bash
deploy_ssh()  # Deploy via SSH and run commands on server
```

### 2. Docker Deployment
```bash
deploy_docker()  # Build and deploy Docker container
```

### 3. Cloud Platforms
```bash
deploy_vercel()  # Deploy to Vercel
deploy_netlify() # Deploy to Netlify
deploy_aws()     # Deploy to AWS S3
```

### 4. File Transfer
```bash
deploy_scp()    # Copy files using SCP
deploy_rsync()  # Sync files using rsync
```

## Customize Your Deployment

Edit `script.sh` and uncomment your preferred deployment method in the `main()` function:

```bash
main() {
    # Choose your deployment method
    deploy_ssh          # SSH deployment
    # deploy_docker     # Docker deployment
    # deploy_vercel     # Vercel deployment
    # deploy_netlify    # Netlify deployment
}
```

## Monitoring Deployment

### View Workflow Status
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Actions" tab
3. Click on the workflow run
4. View logs and status

### Deployment Status Badge
Add to your README.md:
```markdown
![Deploy](https://github.com/username/repo/workflows/Deploy%20to%20Production/badge.svg)
```

## Security Best Practices

‚úÖ Never commit secrets or credentials to the repository  
‚úÖ Always use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data  
‚úÖ Use SSH keys instead of passwords  
‚úÖ Limit SSH key permissions to deployment only  
‚úÖ Use environment protection rules for production  
‚úÖ Enable required reviewers for PRs to main branch  
‚úÖ Use deployment branches protection  

## Rollback Strategy

If deployment fails or issues are found:

```bash
# Revert the merge commit
git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-hash>

# Push to main
git push origin main

# This will trigger a new deployment with the previous working code
```

## Testing Before Production

Consider adding a staging environment:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - develop    # Deploy to staging
      - main       # Deploy to production
```

## Common Issues

### Issue: Script not executable
**Solution:** Make sure to run `chmod +x script.sh` before committing

### Issue: SSH connection fails
**Solution:** 
- Verify SERVER_HOST is correct
- Check SSH key is valid
- Add server to known_hosts

### Issue: Deployment script fails
**Solution:** 
- Check script.sh logs in Actions tab
- Verify all required environment variables are set
- Test script locally first

## Example: Complete Setup

```bash
# 1. Create workflow directory
mkdir -p .github/workflows

# 2. Copy workflow file
cp main.yml .github/workflows/

# 3. Create deployment script
touch script.sh
chmod +x script.sh

# 4. Edit script.sh with your deployment logic

# 5. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Add deployment workflow"
git push origin main

# 6. Add secrets in GitHub repository settings

# 7. Create a PR and merge to test deployment
```

Your automatic deployment is now ready! üöÄ
